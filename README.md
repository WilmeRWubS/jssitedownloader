# jssitedownloader  

One simple single .js file that lets you download a file through the site.  
You might have a reason for not wanting to download a file directly from the file provider.  
Made for me. Alter or remove unnecessary code if needed.   
A lot of the HTML part can be touched as it contains unnecessary bootstrap to make it a bit fancy.
